literally an entire os coded from scratch with kernel,mm,stl
plays bad apple


commands (just read root makefile but for those who dont wanna read:)

make all (compiles all and plays ull need an external vm connector like tigervnc viewer and it plays on localhost:1)
make grub_iso(needed if u wanna run via qemu aka below command)
make qemu_grub (runs it using qemu so no need for tigervnc stuff)
make clean (read the command)

for others just read the root makefile

thanks
